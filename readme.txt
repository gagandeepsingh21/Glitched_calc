Steps:
1. The Calculator functions as a normal calculator but
glitches have been introduced using `glitchMode` and 
`math.random()`. The glitchMode when set to `true` enables the 
glitches and when set to `false` disables them. Currently
the glitchMode has been set to false.
2. To control the glitches or completely remove them the 
'mathr' variable has been defined which is the combinition
of both the `glitchMode and math.random()`. Currently the 
values assigned to `mathr` are 0.1 and 0.2 respectively.
3. But once they are changed to 0 it provides accurate 
calculations results.
